            <H3>MO:DEM 2023 | BETTER IS NEW BIGGER</H3>
            <p>Mo:Dem’s motto was “bigger and better“, however a few years ago we decided to stick only with the “better” part. The reason lies in the desire to build a festival that is ecologically sustainable, green, comfortable and friendly. Mo:Dem policy is not about expanding its numbers but investing in the quality and content.

            Our 2023 edition will not be an exception. We have already started to implement some updates that will make Mo:Dem experience smooth and stressless. The biggest novelties are Campervan Pass and Mo:Dem Express.

                CAMPERVAN PASS
                As magical and unique as it is, the festival location imposes some limitations and problems in the organization. Accommodation for visitors who want to camp in their vehicles is one of them. While the rule about accepting only caravans, campers and motorhomes already exists, it is ignored every year, which creates gridlocks and delays at the entrance.

                Thus from the next edition campervan areas will be only accessible with Campervan Pass. When purchasing a pass you will need to ensure your vehicle qualifies for entering the campervan area. With exact data on the number and size of vehicles, planning and accommodation of vehicles will go faster, more comfortably and with less stress.
                    Campervan Pass will cost symbolic 5€

                MO:DEM EXPRESS
                Mo:Dem Express is a shuttle bus service from Zagreb Airport to Festival Location and return direction. Except for fast transfer from airport to camping area and avoiding gate queue, arrival shuttle bus will include stopping for the shopping.

                As we are aware of the fact that 300 days before the festival no one has ready plans for the summer, we decided to set the deadline for choosing the date and time of departure to 7 days before the start of the festival.
                    Tickets for the arrival and return will be sold separately and price for one direction is 29€

                Both options will be available only at Mo:Dem Shop from Tuesday, 11th October 2022 at 11:00 CEST.

                Stay tuned!</p></div>

                <H3>MO:DEM FESTIVAL 2023 | ZENON RECORDS 20TH ANNIVERSARY</H3>
                <p>Following year legendary Australian Zenon Records marks two decades of dedicated work on creating and releasing the most unique sound of psychedelic progressive music. This big anniversary will be celebrated at the Modem Festival. More precisely on The Swamp stage, which traditionally hosts numerous live acts and DJs from Zenon’s roster.
                    
                Which twenty names will celebrate the twenty years of Zenon? You will find out soon. Starting this week, we will announce the names of the artists who will perform at Mo:Dem Festival 2023.
                    
                The Swamp, The Hive, The Seed…
                    
                …see you on the dancefloor!
                    
                Love. Passion. Commitment.</p>

                <h3>2023 | JOIN, CREATE & PARTICIPATE!</h3>
                <p>I’s the time of year when we keep our eyes and ears open for your suggestions and ideas regarding the future editions of the Mo:Dem Festival. Starting with next Monday, we are opening the following applications:

                    • Restaurants
                    • Chai and Fashion Shops
                    • Music *
                    • Volunteering **
                    • Photography
                    • Visual Art & Installation
                    • Spirallabs (workshops, lectures, healing and performance)

                    *This Music Application is valid for Mo:Dem Festival 2024. The idea of opening the music application a year earlier gave us enough time to deal with applications in detail and to listen to all submissions (whose number exceeded all our expectations). Mo:Dem Festival 2023 lineup, which will be announced in a few weeks, will feature a couple of names that we discovered in last year’s applications.

                    **To all those interested in the Volunteering program, please note that you need a valid festival ticket to participate.
